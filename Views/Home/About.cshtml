        Our agency was founded in 1960 by Scooby and Scrappy Doo.
        The agency expanded in the 1980's across the United States and is now the top
        agency in the midwest.

        In 2000, the agency expanded to Europe and in 2020, the agency will also be
        in Africa and Austrailia.
